Development guide 

To access the source code in Github, you first must have git installed in your native system.
If you are a ubuntu user, you can simply install git by typing the following command in the terminal.
 1. sudo apt-get install git-core

 To setup a branch of Patient Data Exchange Server in your system

 type the following in your terminal,

 1) for read + write access
          "git clone git@github.com:milin/Patient-Data-Exchange-Server.git"

 2) for read only access 
          "git://github.com/milin/Patient-Data-Exchange-Server.git"

 For developers, you probably have to be included in the colaborators lists and then you can have the read + write access after I put your ssh public keys in github.


 For development purposes, you will need apache2,tomcat6, and mysql-server.But if you download the exchangeserver package all these dependencies will be automatically installed in your system. Just be sure to use the default password "signature" for the mysql-server installation when the wizard prompts you to enter the password.
